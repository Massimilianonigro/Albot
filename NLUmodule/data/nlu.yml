- intent: ph_answer
  examples: |
    - Ph is an indicator on how acid or basic a solution is
    - It is a scale that measures how acid or basic a solution is, it ranges from 0 to 14
    - It is something the scientists use to describe acidity of solutions
- intent: cabbage_answer
  examples: |
    - We use it because it is a natural ph indicator
    - Cabbage juice has an high degree of anthocyanin substances, when they come in contact with an acid full of hydronium ions it changes color
    - Some substancese in the cabbage solution change color when they are paired with the ions that characterize acids
    - Because it helps us measure ph having substances that change color when in touch with acids or bases
    - Because mixing it with substances can reveal their ph
