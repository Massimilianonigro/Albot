  examples: |
    - What is ph?
    - Can you explain the concept of ph?
    - How does ph work?
    - Does any liquid have ph properties?
    - How is ph influencing our life?
    - What is the deal with ph?
    - I want an explanation on ph
    - Tell me more about ph

- intent: acid_acid_compare
  examples: |
   - The two ingredients are similar. They are both acids but have different ph
   - One element has ph slighltly more acid than the other
   - One element is more acidic than the other
   - They are two acidics solutions, one more than the other
   - Not much. They are both acids

- intent: basic_acid_compare
  examples: |
   - The two ingredients have vastly different ph properties, one is basic the other is acid
   - One of the two is a base the other is an acid
   - One has a ph lower than 7 the other has a ph higher than 7 
   - One is more acidic than water the other is more basic than water
   - They are at opposite sides of the ph spectrum 
   - One is a basic solution the other an acidic one

- intent: basic_basic_compare
  examples: |
   - They are both bases, not much difference
   - Their ph is both above 7 but is slightly different
   - The two solutions are bases, one of the two is more basic than the other
   - Not a lot, they are bases hence they are similar
   - They have diverse ph but are both bases

- intent: neutral_basic_compare
  examples: |
   - One of them has ph 7 the other has an higher ph
   - Water is a neutral substance, the other is a basis
   - Water is at the center of the ph spectrum, the other is higher
   - One is a basic solution , with a much higher ph than water

- intent: neutral_acid_compare
  examples: |
   - Water has ph 7 and the other has a lower ph
   - Water is a neutral substance the other is an acid
   - There is an acidic substance and a neutral one
   - One of them is an acid the other a neutral substance
   - One acid other neutral
   - One has ph lower than 7 the other 7
- intent: inform_cabbage_solution
  examples: |
    - Do you know how to make the cabbage solution at home?
    - How can i make the cabbage solution?
    - Why are we using a cabbage solution?
    - What is the deal with the cabbage juice?
    - How is the cabbafe solution made?
    - What properties does the cabbage solution have?
    - Why the cabbage solution?
    - Do you know any other solution to check the ph level?
    - How is the cabbage solution helping us?
    - Is there any other solution i can use instead of the cabbage one?
- intent: inform_color_change
  examples: |
    - Why does the cabbege solution turn [red]("color")?
    - Why adding [lemon juice]("ingredient") does the solution turn [red]("color")?
    - Why are we not mixing the liquids into each other?
    - Why is the cabbage turning [yellow]("color")
    - How come the cabbage juice is becoming [red]("color")
    - How is it possible that the juice is now green
    - Why did it change color?
    - Can you explain the change in color
    - Why it has a different color now
    - What happened to the solution 
    - What happens if i pour [milk]("ingredient") in the solution
    - What if i drop the [lemon juice]("ingredient") in the cabbage juice
- intent: ph_answer
  examples: |
    - Ph is an indicator on how acid or basic a solution is
    - It is a scale that measures how acid or basic a solution is, it ranges from 0 to 14
    - It is something the scientists use to describe acidity of solutions
- intent: cabbage_answer
  examples: |
    - We use it because it is a natural ph indicator
    - Cabbage juice has an high degree of anthocyanin substances, when they come in contact with an acid full of hydronium ions it changes color
    - Some substancese in the cabbage solution change color when they are paired with the ions that characterize acids
- intent : inform_ingredient_property
  examples: |
    - What are the ph properties of [Lemon Juice]("ingredient")?
