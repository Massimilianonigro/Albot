    "ph_explanation": [
        "Scientists use something called a pH scale to measure how acidic or basic a liquid is. pH is a number from 0 to 14. From 0 to 7 are acids, with 0 being the strongest. From 7 to 14 are bases with 14 being the strongest base."
    ],
    "cabbage_solution_explanation": [
        "When anthocyanin comes in contact with the hydronium ions in an acid it turns pink, and when it comes in contact with the hydroxide ions in a base it turns blue or green. We refer to cabbage juice as a pH indicator because it can tell us if a substance is acidic or basic by changing colour."

    ],
    "acid_explanation": [
        "Whether a liquid is an acid or base depends on the type of ions in it. If it has a lot of hydrogen ions, then it is an acid. If it has a lot of hydroxide ions, then it is a base. Scientists use something called a pH scale to measure how acidic or basic a liquid is."
    ],
    "base_explanation": [
        "Basic substances contain lots of hydroxide ions. These are a different type of molecule with a small electrical charge. In foods, this means they will taste more bitter. Plenty of things other than food can be basic, however."
    ],
    "color_change_acid": [
        "Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color when it is mixed with an acid or a base. When the liquid is a red or purple color it means that it is more acidic. When the liquid is a blue, green, or yellow color it means that the liquid is more basic."
    ],
    "color_change_base": [
        "Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color when it is mixed with an acid or a base. When the liquid is a red or purple color it means that it is more acidic. When the liquid is a blue, green, or yellow color it means that the liquid is more basic."
    ],
    "color_change_neutral": [
        "Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color when it is mixed with an acid or a base. When the liquid is a red or purple color it means that it is more acidic. When the liquid is a blue, green, or yellow color it means that the liquid is more basic."
    ],
    "properties_acid_ingredient": [
        "Aqueous solutions of acids are electrolytes, meaning that they conduct electrical current. Some acids are strong electrolytes because they ionize completely in water, yielding a great many ions. Other acids are weak electrolytes that exist primarily in a non-ionized form when dissolved in water.",
        "Acids have a sour taste. Lemons, vinegar, and sour candies all contain acids."
    ],
    "properties_neutral_ingredient": [
        "If a substance has a pH of exactly 7, it's neutral. This means it has equal amounts of hydrogen and hydroxide ions. Pure water is a neutral substance."

    "properties_base_ingredient": [
        "Bases taste bitter, feel slippery, and conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Indicator compounds such as litmus can be used to detect bases. "

When anthocyanin comes in contact with the hydronium ions in an acid it turns pink, and when it comes in contact with the hydroxide ions in a base it turns blue or green.We refer to cabbage juice as a pH indicator because it can tell us if a substance is acidic or basic by changing colour. Other pH indicators are litmus paper and phenolphthalein."
